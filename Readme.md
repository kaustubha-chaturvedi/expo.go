# Portfolio Static Site Generator Using Go

## Description

A simple static site generator written in Go. It uses Go's pongo'2 package to render the templates and markdown to write the content.
It is designed to be easily customizable. 
Motivation for this project was to create a simple static site generator that can be used to create a portfolio for me and my friends.
Also, I wanted to learn Go and this project was a good way to do that.

## Clarifications

Yup this repo is based on my [this repo](https://github.com/kaustubha-chaturvedi/portfolio-echo) from previous year that time I was just learning go syntax and it's framework and library ecosystem,
I halted that due to my eams and job search (ofcourse not because of laziness), I am back at learning Golang and this is my final version of static site portfolio,
I hope it to be useful (atleast to me), and to allow anyone to be able to edit this I have used pongo2 as more people are comfortable with jinja2 style templating.
If you are here reaing this please make use of your time at some better place.

## How to edit Theme

To edit the Theme, create you theme in the ThemeDir folder following structure of default theme and add a tailwind config file copying default as base. 
The themes are written in Go's pongo2 template language. Which is similar to Jinja2.
After creating the theme, you can change the theme in the conf.go file by changing the ThemeDir variable to point to your theme and import file in `tailwind.config.js`.
